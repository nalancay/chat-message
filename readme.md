## Use of modules

- **cors**: used to communicate backend and frontend that are in different domains.
- **express**: it is a node module, used to create the backend so this server will help us to make requests, be able to create routes and join it to socketio or websocket to communicate in real time.
- **socketio**: is a module that allows real-time connection to be able to carry out bidirectional communication both from the Backend and the Frontend and that joins express to support both protocols.
- **morgan**: is a module that allows you to see the requests that are arriving through the console.
- **nodemon**: used to restart the code every time we make a change.
- **tailwindcss**: css Framework for styling web applications
